<h1>My Typescript Learning Journey with React files</h1>
<p>This is where I practice my Typescript skills for React, from empty React apps for learning purposes into projects built with React and TypeScript.</p>

<h2>File Stracture</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Files tagged with () is a project that I coded along with the instractor</li>
  <li>Files tagged with [] are projects that I made</li>
  <li>Other than that, it is either an empty file or stuff I used to practice some concepts</li>
</ul>
